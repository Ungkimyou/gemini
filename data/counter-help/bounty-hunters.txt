Counter Strategies

How to beat Bounty Hunters

== Option 1 == 

zEP, Vader, TFP, GMT, Shore/Storm
(does not work vs Pretaunt BH team)
Logic: Vader must outspeed Bossk, then simply keep ability block on Bossk and kill the rest leaving bossk for last.

== Option 2 == 

zVeers, Starck, Snow, Shore, Ranged
Logic: Starck must out pace bossk, cast "Scan all wavelengths" to give 20% TM to entire team, kill weakest unit first

== Option 3 == 

zJTR, BB-8, R2-D2, Scav Rey, +1 
(Can use undersized team of 4)
(can use 3po, but overkill)
Logic: Mind tricks Bossk, BB-8 and r2 should go before bossk, use r2 "improvise" first, kill boba/jango first
