How to mod your TANKS 
Disclaimer: I run Crit Avoidance on most tanks to increase survival. Specifically, Fost, Vandor, Zaalbar, L3-37, Zombie, Kanaan, SiT, GK I emphasize CA arrows 24-35%

== First Order ==

KRU
Priorities: Tenacity > Health > Speed
Targets: 100%+ Tenacity, 50k+ Health, 215+ Speed
Goal prevent daze/expose/buff immunity from ewoks/zfinn

FOST
Priorities: Tenacity > Defense > Speed
Targets: 100%+ Tenacity, 50%+ Defense, 200+ Speed
Goal durability and prevent debuffs

== Bounty Hunters ==

Bossk
Priorities: Speed > Tenacity > Defense
Targets: 280+ Speed, 100%+ Tenacity, 45%+ Defense
Goal fast to taunt first, tenacious to prevent ability block

== Empire ==

Shore
Priorities: Health > Protection > Speed
Targets: 185+ Speed
Alot of TM gain through Veers lead, health drives improved healing while taunting

== Scoundrels ==

Vandor Chewie
Priorities: Health > Speed > Crit Chance
Targets: 40k+ Health, 225+ Speed, +10% CC
Under Qira lead crits heal protection causing him to be prepared

L3-37
Priorities: Health > Defense > Crit Chance
Targets: 40k+ Health, 45%+ Armor, +10% CC
Paired with Qi'ra crits heal 10% protection

ZaalBar
Priorities: Tenacity > Defense > Health
Targets: 100%+ Tenacity, 45%+ Defense
If paired with L3 Tenacity drops down the list, passive taunt makes speed less priority

== Jedi ==

Old Ben
Priorities: Speed > Potency > Defense
Targets: 210+ Speed, 80%+ Potency, 45%+ Armor
Quick use of mind tricks gives control of battle, defense+defense up makes him durable

== Night Sisters ==

Zombie
Priorities: Speed > Protection > Health
Targets: 220+ Speed, 70k+ Protection, 35k+ Health
If troopers are the top counter to NS, make zombie durable to sustain troopers first onslaught, 120k combined hitpoints and 35% Crit avoidance make troopers a failed battle most often
